<p><b>The Wuhan ban</b></p>
<p>The number of infections and deaths from the Wuhan virus continued to rise. More than 99% of the cases are in China. Several countries, including America and Australia, banned the entry of non-citizens who have recently visited China. Hong Kong announced that visitors from the Chinese mainland would have to undergo quarantine for 14 days; medical workers went on strike, calling for a complete closure of the Hong Kong mainland border. A Chinese diplomat accused other countries of over-reacting by barring travellers from China.</p>
<p><b>The world this week</b> Business</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis in China unnerved the country’s stock markets. The CSI index fell by 8% in a day, its worst performance since August 2015, before rebounding somewhat. As an emergency measure China’s central bank injected extra liquidity into the ﬁnancial system, the biggest such one-day intervention since 2004, and cut some interest rates. Macau closed its casinos for two weeks. </p>
<p>China is the linchpin in the supply chains of many global manufacturers, but the disruption from the coronavirus lockdown has been most acute in the motor industry. Hyundai halted production at its factories in South Korea because it couldn’t get components from China. Many foreign carmakers in China extended the Chinese new year break and kept their plants closed. </p>
<p>Keeping to one of its pledges in the “phase one” trade deal with America, China’s government said it would cut tariﬀs on $75bn-worth of American exports. Some said the announcement was timed to cheer the markets. China is also committed to make extensive purchases of American goods under phase one, but that could be diﬃcult amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The price of oil fell sharply, in part because demand from Chinese industry and international airlines is expected to drop because of the Wuhan virus. OPEC and Russia met to discuss emergency cuts to output that could shore up prices. BP said that the outbreak could reduce projected global growth in oil demand this year by up to 40%. </p>
