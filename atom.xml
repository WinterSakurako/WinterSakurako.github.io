    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>来源：The Economist：February 8th 2020<br><br><br><font color="red"><b>Hong Kong and the mainland</b></font><br><font size="5"><b>Keep out</b></font></p><p><font size="0.5">HONG KONG</font><br><b>The coronavirus is fuelling tensions in a protest-racked city</b><br>“There is noreason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.” So declared the World Health Organisation’s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on February 3rd after several countries, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, had closed their borders with China or (like America and Australia) announced that foreign citizens who had recently visited China would be barred from entering. Yet many people in Hong Kong want the territory to seal itself oﬀ from the Chinese mainland. Their demands are putting new political pressure on the territory’s leader, Carrie Lam, after months of pro-democracy unrest. As The Economist went to press, 21people in Hong Kong had been detected with the virus, of whom seven were from the mainland. Six of the others were Hong Kong residents who caught it while travelling in China. They included a man whose death, attributed to the virus, was announced on February 4th. It was the ﬁrst such fatality in the territory and only the second outside the Chinese mainland (the other was in the Philippines). The remaining eight cases involved infections that occurred in Hong Kong itself. </p><p>Mrs Lam has responded with evertighter controls. On January 27th visitors from Hubei, the province where the virus was discovered, were banned from entering Hong Kong. On January 30th six of 14 border checkpoints were closed. Hong Kongers who had travelled to Hubei were ordered into quarantine centres. The mainland’s government also imposed restrictions, stopping the issuing of permits for tourist trips to Hong Kong. The number of mainlanders arriving at border posts<br>other than the airport fell by 90% compared with two weeks earlier. Mrs Lam said that closing the border entirely would be “discriminatory”, but four days later she announced that remaining entry points, apart from the airport, two road bridges and a cruise terminal, would be closed from February 4th. On February 5th she announced that anyone arriving from the mainland would be quarantined for 14 days and the cruise terminal would be shut. </p><p>For some Hong Kongers, these measures have not been enough. On February 3rd around 3,000 non-essential medical staﬀ working in public hospitals went on indeﬁnite strike—the biggest such action in the health system’s history. Their demands include the full closure of the border. The following day their ranks swelled to 7,000. They have vowed to continue their strike, despite Mrs Lam’s measures. </p><p>She is in murky political water. The strikers belong to a recently formed union with links to activists who have been at the forefront of the anti-government unrest that has roiled the territory since June. Other pro-democracy unions have threatened to join them, including one for bus drivers. </p><p>The central government, however, would not be happy with a total ban. It accused America of sowing fear when it became the ﬁrst country to barforeign travellers coming from China. China’s acting ambassador to Israel compared such controls to the turning away of Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. The embassy later apologised, saying there was “no intention whatsoever to compare the dark days of the Holocaust with the current situation”.</p><p>But many Hong Kongers are fearful. Memories are still fresh of SARS in 2003, a disease caused by another coronavirus discovered in China. That outbreak infected about 1,750 people in Hong Kong and killed almost 300. Mrs Lam, not least, will be mindful of events that year. Public anger over the government’s perceived hesitancy in handling SARS fuelled unrest caused by a proposed national-security bill. The crisis eventually prompted the central government to replace Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong’s ﬁrst post-colonial leader. </p><p>Mrs Lam appears to have retained the central government’s backing during the past few months of turmoil on Hong Kong’s streets. But in a territory where distrust of the government runs deep, it is unlikely that her response to the new coronavirus will boost her abysmal ratings at home.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>来源：The Economist：February 8th 2020<br><br><br><font color="red"><b>The Wuhan virus</b></font><br><font size="5"><b>Under observation</b></font></p><p><font size="0.5">BEIJING</font><br><b>A weak health-care system complicates China’s battle with the coronavirus</b><br>The doctors who examined Rana Zhou’s parents decided that the couple had probably caught the coronavirus which has been sweeping their home city, Wuhan, and spreading globally. But they said they did not have enough test kits to be sure. Instead of ﬁnding them beds in a hospital, oﬃcials in their neighbourhood told them to go to one of many hotels which the government has requisitioned in order to monitor and isolate people with minor virus-related symptoms. But when her father’s fever worsened, staﬀ said they could not take care of him. They told the pair they would have to return home. </p><p>It is a scary time to be ill in Wuhan. The city has one-third of all conﬁrmed infections by the virus and three-quarters of the deaths caused by it. People there are barred from travelling elsewhere (similar rules apply across Hubei, a Syria-sized province of which Wuhan is the capital). Since late January military medics have been piling into the city. Soldiers are helping enforce its cordons. The army’s growing presence reassures many people, says a resident. But some ﬁnd it unnerving. </p><p>With hospitals brimming, the local government has announced new rules. Rather than visiting hospitals, people who think they might have the virus should tell district oﬃcials about their symptoms and seek examinations at local clinics—facilities which, in normal times, many people eschew in favour of what they regard as the hospitals’ more professional care. Wuhan has opened makeshift hospitals in an exhibition centre and a sports arena to house patients who are only mildly ill from the virus. Elsewhere in China health services are also under strain, even if the pressure is less than in Hubei. Oﬃcials in many places have banned non-essential hospital visits to avoid contagion. But many people, afraid of catching the virus, now avoid hospitals anyway, except in emergencies. </p><p>China’s health system can cope better with shocks than in 2003 during the sars outbreak. At that time, oﬃcials feared that the spread of the virus might be hidden because rural residents, lacking health insurance, would avoid hospitals. The government tried to allay such concerns by oﬀering free treatment for sars. Since then it has considerably expanded access to state-funded insurance schemes. More than 95% of Chinese are now covered. Outof-pocket payments have fallen from about 60% of medical expenses to 30%. But for poorer people, the costs can still be crippling. The government recently promised that it would pay for all treatment related to the new virus. That was too late for a pregnant woman infected in Wuhan. She died after her husband decided he could no longer aﬀord the bill, according to a doctor there interviewed by Caixin, a magazine. The policy changed the next day.</p><p><b>Barely better than barefoot </b><br>The government has spent lavishly on infrastructure, but its investment in health care has failed to keep up. China says it has about 2.6 doctors for every 1,000 people, higher than the average for middle-income countries. But the World Health Organisation says half of China’s doctors do not have a bachelor’s degree. Among those in villages and small towns, only 10-15% do. Some practise traditional Chinese medicine, a form of treatment that has government approval but little scientiﬁc basis (stocks of an oral liquid based on such medicine have been ﬂying oﬀ shelves since a recent report by Xinhua, an oﬃcial news agency, that it can “suppress” the virus). There is also an acute shortage of nurses. The average in rich countries is three per doctor. In China it is only one. </p><p>China’s investment in health care has mostly gone to big hospitals in cities. Wuhan has about half of Hubei’s best medical facilities, but only about one-ﬁfth of the province’s population. Far less attention has been paid to primary-care clinics, which in more developed systems handle minor ailments and escalate the rest to specialists. Only about 5% of China’s registered doctors serve as general practitioners. The average in the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries, is 23%. After Wuhan imposed a lockdown in late January, panicky residents converged on large hospitals seeking reassurance. The queues would have promoted cross-infection, says Xi Chen of Yale University. </p><p>Public anger about health care, including the gouging of patients by hospitals, has triggered occasional violence against doctors. In late January a man attacked medical staﬀ in Wuhan after his father-in-law died from the virus. But the system’s public image may have improved during the current crisis. Many people praise doctors’willingness to join theﬁght in Hubei, despite high rates of infection among medical workers there. They will need such support in the struggle ahead.</p>]]></content>

In fact, you might lose more weight without them.</p><p>The fascinating finding comes from a study published today in JAMA that found dieting adults who wore activity monitors for 18 months lost significantly fewer pounds over that time than those who did not.</p><p>The results suggest that activity monitors may not change our behavior in the way we expected, and raise interesting questions about the tangled relationships between exercise, eating, our willpower and our waistlines.</p><p>There have been tantalizing hints in a few studies recently that new technologies such as wearable activity monitors, which tell us how much we are moving and how many calories we have burned during the day, might help some people to drop pounds.</p><p>Those studies, however, had typically been small scale and short term, so it was still unclear how much activity monitors might aid in weight loss.</p><p>So for the new study, University of Pittsburgh scientists from the Physical Activity and Weight Management Research Center and their colleagues gathered almost 500 young, overweight men and women who wanted to lose weight. The recruits ranged in age from 18 to 35 since, presumably, these younger volunteers would be familiar with and competent using technologies such as activity trackers and any learning curve would be slight.</p><p>The volunteers were weighed and their general health and fitness assessed.</p><p>Then, for the first six months of the study, the volunteers followed a straightforward, low-calorie diet designed to provide steady weight loss and were urged to start moving more, aiming for at least 100 minutes of moderate activity each week. They kept daily food and exercise diaries and attended weekly counseling sessions.</p><p>By the end of six months, everyone had lost weight. And then the actual experiment began.</p><p>The scientists now divided their volunteers in half. One group was told to start logging their daily exercise sessions onto a study website.</p><p>The others were given a monitor designed to be worn on the upper arm that would track their physical activity and provide feedback about whether they were achieving goals for step counts, calorie expenditure and so on.</p><p>We were pretty confident that the volunteers in the group using the activity monitors would exercise more, monitor their calorie intake better, and lose more weight than the people in the self-monitoring group, says John Jakicic, a distinguished professor in the department of health and physical activity at the University of Pittsburgh and the studys lead author.</p><p>For 18 months, the volunteers logged into the study website or wore the monitor on most days. Counselors occasionally checked with everyone by phone and sent encouraging text messages.</p><p>After 18 months  and two years after the beginning of the study  all of the volunteers returned to the lab to repeat their measurements from the start.</p><p>Most were thinner now than at the start of the study (although many had regained some of the weight that they had lost during the first six months).</p><p>Those who had not worn activity monitors were, on average, about 13 pounds lighter now than two years ago.</p><p>Those who had worn the monitors, however, weighed only about 8 pounds less than at the start.</p><p>We were definitely surprised, Dr. Jakicic says.</p><p>The reasons for the difference in weight loss are not immediately clear, he says.</p><p>Theoretically, those using the monitors might have been so inspired to exercise that they moved a lot, developed large appetites, and overate, blunting any weight loss from the workouts, he says.</p><p>But in fact, the data from the monitors shows that those wearing the technology generally exercised less than those in the other group.</p><p>So perhaps the monitors resulted in less motivation to move, Dr. Jakicic says. It is possible, he says, that when those wearing the trackers realized they would not reach their daily exercise goal, they simply gave up, leading to relatively low caloric expenditure on those days, and less weight loss overall than among those not using the technology.</p><p>The people using the monitors may also have assumed that, in some roundabout way, the technology removed responsibility from them for monitoring their energy intake, Dr. Jakicic says. People may have focused on the technology and forgotten to focus on their behaviors and ate too much, he says.</p><p>Dr. Jakicic and his colleagues hope to conduct follow-up studies that will directly examine how activity monitors affect exercise motivation and subsequent weight loss.</p><p>What these results say to me is that we still have a great deal to learn about how monitoring technologies affect real-life actions, Dr. Jakicic says. Peoples responses to a monitor strapped to their arm may not always be rational and could result in behaviors that are the opposite of those that the monitor would be expected to encourage.</p><p>In other words, we humans are strange and often our own worst enemies, especially when it comes to trying to increase our exercise or reduce our weight.</p>]]></content>
